## Preview

## Installation
Clone `extension` branch and archive to Mac App.

Currently the Source Editor Extension feature in Xcode 8 is not very stable. You may find that the command is sometimes not showing up, or not available (grayed out). Please try again or create an issue if you have a problem.

## Usage
In the menu open **[Editor] -> [Swimat] -> [Format]** or map it to a hot-key you like in Xcode's Key Binding preferences.
